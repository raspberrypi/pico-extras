 *   Adds support for playing tones using PWM.
 *  
 *   Every sound humans encounter consists of one or more frequencies, and the
 *   way the ear interprets those sounds  is called pitch.
 *
 *   In order to produce a variety of pitches, a digital signal needs to convey
 *   the frequency of sound it is trying to reproduce. The simplest approach is
 *   to generate a 50% duty cycle pulse stream and set the frequency to the
 *   desired pitch.
